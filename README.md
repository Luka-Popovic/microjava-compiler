# MicroJava Compiler
Compiler for the MicroJava language (a small, object-oriented language based on Java) which generates a bytecode file that can be executed by the MicroJava VM. The scanner is implemented by using JFlex, while the parser uses CUP.

The solution is implemented in four stages:
- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis
- Semantic analysis
- Code Generation
